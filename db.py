    """Blockchain is simply a piece of software that enables the sharing of value such as payments, between peers online. Importantly, blockchain allows the
information to be shared without the need to go through any third-party
intermediaries such as banks or payment companies. As its name suggests

small part of the history of the transactions that have taken places on the blockchain.

    """Cryptocurrencies work through the shared ledger or blockchain. This technology provides them with a high security system with the capacity to prevent, for example, that the same digital asset can be transferred twice or that it is falsified.Cryptocurrencies have several differentiating characteristics compared to traditional systems: they are not regulated or controlled by any institution and they do not require intermediaries in transactions.
